; Reminders to future self:
; 1. Mind the distinction between time of sampling (Timestamp) and time of
; reception (ReceptionTime)
; 2. The variables being stored in the database are not always the ones
; captured from the sensors. For example: for water pressure, the reading
; from the water pressure sensor is not compensated for atmospheric
; pressure. One may, for example, subtract the atmospheric pressure
; from the water pressure reading before storing it in the database.
; Another example would be unit conversion: sensor reports in mg/L but uM
; is preferred for storage and processing.
